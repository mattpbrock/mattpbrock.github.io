<p>Music has been part of who I am for a long, long time. Ever since my brother got his shiny red Flying V I've been enamored with the magical dance between notes and words.</p>

<h3>My Album</h3>

<p>I released my first studio album, <i>From the Land of Shadows</i> in March, 2013. Listen below, or find it on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/from-the-land-of-shadows/id608713713" title="Matt Brock's From the Land of Shadows on iTunes">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5a8Rh1ZTDQeEZJwvHCXfsZ" title="Matt Brock's From the Land of Shadows on Spotify">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Matt+Brock+From+the+Land+of+Shadows" title="Just a Google search..." target="_blank">probably everywhere else</a>.

<h3>Leading Worship</h3>

<p>I also love to lead worship for church youth retreats and special events. I've led retreats and performed all across the Southeast.</p>
