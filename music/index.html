<h1>Matt Brock Music</h1>
<p>Music has been part of who I am for a long, long time. Ever since my brother got his shiny red Flying V I've been enamored with the dance between notes and words. If you're interested in booking me, email me at <a href="mailto:mattbrockmusic@gmail.com">mattbrockmusic@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h4>My Album</h4>
<p>I released my first studio album, <i>From the Land of Shadows</i> in March, 2013.</p>
<h4>Retreats</h4>
<p>I also lead worship for church youth retreats.</p>
