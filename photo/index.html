<p>Growing up, I wanted to be the guy who got to turn ideas into things you could touch and hold and move. The challenge to impose physical constraints upon the abstract captivated my imagination. Initially, it presented itself as a clinical obsession with Legos. I was fascinated with the picture of the Millennium Falcon on the front of the box and was, strangely, inspired and not deterred by having no idea how to get there. For me, the process was thrill.</p>
<p>My favorite thing to do in the world is to wrap a voice around the Beauty that already exists. Each bow of the shutter is my humble attempt at scooping up a handful of that deeply running but gloriously accessible stream. Your story has immeasurable value and deserves to be preserved in a beautiful way. I would love to help you tell it.</p>
