<p>Growing up, I wanted to be the guy who got to turn ideas into things you could touch and hold and move. My imagination was captivated by the challenge to impose physical constraints upon the abstract.</p>

<p>Initially, it presented itself as a clinical obsession with Legos. I was fascinated with the picture of the Millennium Falcon or the Titanic or King Arthur's Castle on the front of the box and was&mdash;strangely&mdash;inspired and not deterred by having no idea how to get there. For me, <em>the process was the thrill.</em></p>

<p>We live most of our lives swimming inside our own heads. Drowning in ideas of ourselves and how we fit into the world around us. Yet each of us is longing to be swept up into something real and raw and meaningful. But you are real. And you are full of worth. I believe your story is something wonderful, and it deserves to be preserved in a beautiful way. I would love to help you tell it.</p>
