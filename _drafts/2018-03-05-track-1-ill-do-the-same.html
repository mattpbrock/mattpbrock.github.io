<div class="song__stanza">
  Everything warm and everything pure<br />
  None of it’s stirring anymore<br />
  Have the birds forgotten how to fly,<br />
  How to welcome the morning light?
</div>
<div class="song__stanza">
  Brighter hearts, they could brave this cold<br />
  But we’ve only got our own<br />
  So what’s the point in being stuck here together<br />
  If we remain altogether alone?
</div>
<div class="song__stanza">
  Will our hearts ever shake off this permafrost?<br />
  Will the burnin’ sun be strong enough to save us?
</div>
<div class="song__stanza song__chorus">
  Soon we’ll know who we really are<br />
  Soon these unbelieving eyes will see<br />
  Soon we’ll warm these frozen lungs of ours<br />
  And finally breathe<br />
  Soon it will be Spring
</div>
<div class="song__stanza">
  The color’s gone, all turned to stone<br />
  And all the water’s sinkin’ low<br />
  Now I’ve been told that a King will come<br />
  To summon all His people home
</div>
<div class="song__stanza song__chorus">
  Soon we’ll know who we really are<br />
  Soon these unbelieving eyes will see<br />
  Soon we’ll warm these frozen lungs of ours<br />
  And finally breathe
</div>
<div class="song__stanza">
  Writhing in pain as the ground when it’s breaking<br />
  Thawed out by grace, was it worth this much blood?<br />
  Sins are erased and mighty mountains are shaken<br />
  I’ll do the same for you, my love, my love<br />
  I’ll do the same for you always, my love<br />
  I’ll do the same for you always
</div>
<div class="song__stanza song__chorus">
  Soon we’ll know who we really are<br />
  Soon these unbelieving eyes will see<br />
  Soon we’ll warm these frozen lungs of ours<br />
  And finally breathe<br />
  Soon it will be Spring
</div>
<div class="song__stanza">
  I’ll do the same for you, my love, my love<br />
  I’ll do the same for you always, my love<br />
  I’ll do the same for you always
</div>
