<p>I've been coding for about a year and a half now. Honestly, I never thought I would enjoy it so much. It's pretty much the perfect fit for my (at times) frustratingly balanced left and right brain. There's just enough geek in it to satisfy my itch for logic and order, and just enough open-endedness to let me stretch my creative legs.</p>

<p>If you're in need of a website, I'd love to help out. Anything from a simple site like this one to a full-featured business site. I work with Wordpress and Squarespace, so it will always be easy and painless for you.</p>
