<p>I've been coding since 2014. Honestly, I never thought I would enjoy it so much. It's pretty much the perfect fit for my (at times) frustratingly balanced left and right brain. There's just enough geek in it to satisfy my itch for logic and order, and just enough open-endedness to let me stretch my creative legs.</p>

<h3>Websites</h3>
<p>If you're in need of a website, I'd love to help out. Anything from a simple site like this one to a full-featured business site. I primarily work with Wordpress, but can build a Squarespace site as well. Whatever route we take, it will always be easy and painless for you.</p>
<p>I do freelance work ranging from a simple website setup to design and development. Here are some of the most recent projects I've worked on.</p>

<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>Since early 2015, I've been taking programming courses over at <a href="http://referrals.trhou.se/mattbrock" title="Try Treehouse!" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>. Their in-depth tutorials have not just brought me up to speed, but have helped me become a real programmer. For real, if you're interested in coding at all, I highly recommend them.</p>
<p>I also make stuff on Codepen. It's a great place to find some inspiration, work out an idea, or just try something new. <a href="https://codepen.io/mattpbrock/" title="Matt Brock on Codepen">Here are a few</a> of my favorite little bits of code that I've created there.</p>
